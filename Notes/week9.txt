Week 9
	Arrays
	Ordered list of values
	- array has a single name
	- each value has a numeric index
	- an array of size N is indexed from 0 to N-1
	- can only store the same value type(int, String)
 
 Is an object and must be instantiated
 can allocate as much memory as needed for the array
 
	Declaring Arrays
		int[] scores = new int[10];
		-the type of variable scores is int[] (an array of integers)
		- the reference variable "scores" is set to a new object than can hold integers
	
	Java provides two ways to declare arrays
		
		int[] grades;
		int grades[];
		- the first is consistent with other types of declarations
	
	EXAMPLES
	int[] weghts = new int[2000];
	double[] prices = new double{500};
	
	boolean[] flags;
	flags = new boolean[20];
	
	char codes = new char[1750];
	
	Accessing Arrays Elements(Values)
	
		use the array name followed by the position or index in brackets
			scores[2]
			
		an element can be assigned, used for calculation or printed
		
	For loops are effective for manipulating the contents of an array
		for loops are useful when you know exactly how many times you need to repeat a process
		the size of this array provides this information
	
	*good idea to store a constant that stores the size of the array*
	
	For vs for-each loop
		
		for(int value : list)
			system.out.println(value + " ");
		
		for (int index = 0; index < LIMIT; index++)
		System.out.println(list[index] + " ");
		
		these two statements are equivalent 
		
	Index and Boundries
		each array has a public constnt cslled length tht stores the size
			referenced using the array name
		holds the number of elements, not the largest index
		
	Initializer list
		can be used to fill an array in one step
		*need to have values in advanced*
		values are delimited by braces, and seperated bby commas.
		
			int[] units = {157,4323,89,944,540,269,34,282,23433};
			
			char[] letterGrades = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F'};
			
			do not skip values can not leave blank spaces in the array
			
	Two Dimensional Arrays
		a table of elements
	2-D arrays are declared by specifying the size of each dimension 
	EXAMPLE
		int[][] = table new int[12][50];
	an element is refrenced using two index values	
		table [6][34]
	the array stored in one row can be specified using one index	
		table[3]: the array of elemnts table[3][0]
		table[3][1],...,table[3][49]
	for each dimension add another nested loop
	
	ArrayListClass
	part of java util.package
	can change size 
	can not use primitive data typesslower performance
