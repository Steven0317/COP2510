Review for lab exam 2	
	lab 7 is vital
	lab 5(twelve days) specifically
	open book/notes/canvas material
	
1 dimensional array and loops for behavior 

extra credit will be star pattern (10 points)

number sequences will help with the actual test
	


	
Object Oriented Programming
	helps us organize a large program into small modules
	design an intricate program
	find and remove errors
	
Classes
	can contain data declarations and method declarations

Example-Bank account
	
class called account
	state can include: owners name, acct number, current balance
	
	behavior can include: deposits, withdrawals, interest added

private declaration can not access the data directly for security reasons

	first data declarations
	then method declarations

Driver program
	drives the use of other more intersting parts of a program
	used to test other parts of the software
	
Constructor

	a special method that is used to set up an object when it is initially created
	
	constructors have the smae name as the class

	do not have to define a constructor for a class
		each class has a default that accepts no arguments(data you recieve from the method)
	
example
	no return type specified in header
	common error- putting a return type makes it a regular mathod with the same name as the class

Instance Data

	Classes declare the type of the data, but it does not reserve memory space for it

	Whenever an Account object is created;  a name variable is created as well
UML diagram ==> giant flowchart for creating OOP

Method
	a method is a named group of statements
	
	a method declaration specifies the code that is executed when a method is invoked
	
	every method in java is part of a particular class


Method - Flow of Control
	
	flow begins at main
		resemebles nested loops situations

Method Header

	declaration begins with a header

	int add(int num1. int num2)

	return type method name (parameter list)

	parameter list specifies the type and name of each parameter

	name of a parameter in the method declaration is called a formal parameter

Method Body

	follows the method headrer

	group of code that defines the method is included here

		int add(int num1, int num2)
		{
			int sum = num1 + num 2;
			
				return sum;
		}

Return Statement

	return type of a method indicates the type of value that the method send back to the calling location

	a method that does not return a value has a void return type
